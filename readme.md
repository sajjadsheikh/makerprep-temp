# MakerPrep

Welcome to MakerPrep! This [GitHub Repository](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1) will serve as your gateway to the curiculuum for the remainder of this course.

This course will provide you with a foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That being said, there is only so much material that can be covered in 56 hours. There is no substitute for hard work, and for those of you who are trying to make a career change, your success in this course, and subsequently as a Software Engineer, is heavily dependent on what you invest in the curiculuum. Like many things in life, the more you put in, the more you get out.

## Expectations

1. Come to class every night for the full amount of allotted time.
2. Submit a short feedback survey at the end of every lesson.
3. Complete all the assigned tasks to the best of your ability.
4. Encourage and help your fellow students to the best of your ability.
5. Don't be an asshole.

That's it. Show up to class every night, work hard, have fun (don't forget this one), pick our brains, and most importantly, take care of each other. That's the MakerSquare way.
