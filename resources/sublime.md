# Sublime Text Editor

Sublime Text is a powerful text-editor, and the editor of choice at Makersquare. It comes equipped with a Python based API that allows developers (such as yourselves!) to write custom plugins that extend its functionality. In order to take advantage of these plugins, you’ll need to install the [Sublime Text Package Manager](https://packagecontrol.io)

## Installing the Markdown Preview Package

Once you’ve installed the Sublime Text package manager, open up Sublime and hit [ctrl/command + shift + p], this will open up a dropdown menu. Begin typing until ‘Package Control: Install Package’ has been autocompleted and then hit enter, this will open a different dropdown menu where you can select a package to install.

Begin typing until ‘Markdown Preview’ has been autocompleted. This will install the ‘Markdown Preview’ package, and open up the documentation as a text file.

Time to test it! Copy and paste the Markdown from this [Markdown Reference](markdown_reference.md) into an empty text file. 
**Note**: GitHub automatically converts .md files from plain text to styled text. If you're copying the Markdown reference from GitHub, make sure you copy the plain text by clicking the "Raw" button at the top of the Markdown preview. If you've cloned the repo to your local machine and are looking at the Markdown file in your text editor, you won't have this problem.

Hit [ctrl/command + shift + p] and type until ‘Markdown Preview: Preview in Browser’ has been autocompleted, then hit enter, select Markdown, then hit enter again. The markdown document should now appear in your browser, rendered as a styled html page!
