This is a limited reference for Markdown. Markdown is a markup (confusing, I know) syntax for annotating plain text such that it can be converted later to rich text (or in this case, html), and since this reference is itself written in Markdown, it can be converted automatically to a styled HTML document.

# Reference

Here is some normal text. A paragraph, even!

## Headings

# before a line makes it a header.

## The more #'s, the smaller the header.

### Even smaller...

###### Quite small

## Styling Text

*Surrounding text with astericks renders it in italics*

**Surrounding text with two astericks renders it in bold**

***Surrounding text with three astericks renders it in bold and italics*** 

~~Surrounding text with tildes (squigglies) renders it with a strikethrough.~~

Sometimes you want to embed some \*stylized text\* right into **your paragraph.** Pretty cool, right!

## Lists

Asterickss can be used to define unordered lists

* Item
* Item
* Another item

So can plus symbols

+ Item
+ Item
+ One more item

...and minus symbols too

- Item
- Item
- One last item

Ordered lists can be created using the format: #.

1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three

And of course, lists can have sublists

1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three
  1.Sub-item
  2.Sub-item
4. Item four

## Code Snippets

Backticks are used to denote code blocks

 ```javascript
 var variable = 'hello';
 ```

 And they can be used `console.log('Hello world!')` in-line as well.
